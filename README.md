# ChatbotwithTS
Project Title: Talk with TS (Tamil Chatbot using Groq AI)
This project is a friendly chatbot built using Python Flask. It lets users chat with a bot named "TS", who can respond in casual Tamil style and also answer general questions using AI from Groq (a free alternative to OpenAI).

 What it does:
If you say "hi", "how are you?", or "bye", the bot responds in simple, fun Tamil.

For other questions (like "Who is Elon Musk?"), it uses Groq's LLaMA 3 AI model to answer in English.

The chat works through a web interface where users type messages and get replies instantly.

 What it uses:
Flask – to create the web app

Groq API – to use the free AI model (LLaMA 3)

HTML/CSS – for a simple chatbot interface

 Who can use it?
Anyone who wants to chat with a smart Tamil-flavored bot

Useful for learning, fun chatting, or basic AI Q&A
